            A man is smoking a cigarette and blowing smoke rings into the

            hazardous to your health!”

            A programmer is walking along a beach and finds a lamp.&nbsp; He
            rubs the lamp, and a genie appears.&nbsp; “I am the most powerful
            genie in the world.&nbsp; I can grant you any wish, but only one
            wish.”

            The programmer pulls out a map, points to it and says, “I’d want

          </p>
          <p>
            The genie responds, “Gee, I don’t know.&nbsp; Those people have been
            fighting for millennia.&nbsp; I can do just about anything, but this
            is likely beyond my limits.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The programmer then says, “Well, I am a programmer, and my programs
            have lots of users.&nbsp; Please make all my users satisfied with my
            software and let them ask for sensible changes.”
          </p>

            A programmer finds himself in front of a committee that decides
            whether he should go to Heaven or Hell.&nbsp; The committee tells
            the programmer he has a say in the matter and asks him if he wants
            to see either Heaven or Hell before stating his preference.
          </p>

            “Sure,” the programmer replies.&nbsp; “I have a pretty good idea

            The programmer compiled an array of reasons as to why he can’t find
            a girlfriend with a good &lt;HEAD&gt; on her &lt;BODY&gt;, reason 0
            being that he has limited cache.&nbsp; So he searches his memory to
            recall connecting to the TCP/IP tunnel of his last girlfriend —
            sometimes even without a secure socket.&nbsp; His last girlfriend
            always complained about his lack of comments. He fumed,{" "}
            <i>“I hate commenting!”&nbsp; </i>Realizing it was a program
            requirement, he told her she had nice bits.&nbsp; This resulted in a
            Syntax Error.&nbsp; Now she demanded a massage, but this was
            rejected as “Feature Creep.”&nbsp; He smacked her back-end and
            shouted, <i>“Who’s your parent node?!”&nbsp; </i>He scanned for open
            ports.&nbsp; He attempted to install a backdoor worm but her
            response was 403.&nbsp; While his data uploaded into her input
            device, she considered terminating the process.&nbsp; But instead
            she initiated a Do While loop where she recalled a previous
            boyfriend with a larger pointer.&nbsp; To expedite the routine
            routine, she screamed,{" "}
